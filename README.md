# pyBotB

Python library for interacting with Battle of the Bits API.

Complete, but I still need to write proper docs...

## Usage

Proper full docs will appear soon. For now, here's the basics:

* API object is in `pybotb.botb.BotB`; you create this once and do all subsequent calls on it
* Type dataclasses are in `pybotb.types`

For more explanations, see the code comments, or browse the WIP docs:

* [pyBotB API](https://knuxify.github.io/pyBotB/main/usage/api.html)
* [Data classes](https://knuxify.github.io/pyBotB/main/usage/data_classes.html) (list of object types)

There is also a [guide to the BotB API](https://knuxify.github.io/pyBotB/main/botb_api.html) for anyone wanting to implement their own API library.
