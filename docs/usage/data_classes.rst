Data Classes
=============================

For convenience, pyBotB provides some data classes that abstract away the
basic data structures of BotB. These classes are returned by the BotB API
functions.

.. currentmodule:: pybotb

.. automodule:: pybotb.botb
   :no-index:
   :members:
   :exclude-members: BotB, BotBHacks
